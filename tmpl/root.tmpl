    Writing:
    <span class="text-base italic">
      I write as a way to grow and process the things that are naturally
      occupying my mind. These writings will range from technical topics to gardening
      strategies, but they will all have some philosophical abstract which
      drives my writing about concrete things. I believe that thinking
      time is something we are loosing quickly in the battle for our
      attention driven by the internet. Personally, I have attempted to
      optimize my device use and have thought quite a bit about it
      <a href="/writing/devices-strategy">here</a>.
      The goal of this silliness is to create as much space as possible
      to ponder things. This means that when I go the bathroom, I do not
      have a device to pull out and spend my attention, but I get to think
      about things, like parenting, and how to write better css.

    Work:
    <span class="text-base italic">
      I dropped out of college in 2009 and spent the following summer
      selling pest control door-to-door. Motivated from door-to-door sales
      as an introvert, I quickly began brainstorming on what I could be
      working on next. I was lucky enough to get into programming food
      sorting equipment through my father's business. In this time, I
      continued to ponder how to spend 80% of my work life in my sweet
      spot. This eventually led me to programming for the web.

        <p class="text-gray-900 mb-2">
          I joined AdvicePay as an opportuntiy to use Go on a daily basis. 
          The project existed as a couple hundred files in a single directory.
          I helped organize and create a framework for this pile, and we 
          launched the product a couple of months after I got involved.
          It is cash-flow positive today after a small investment.

        <p class="text-gray-900 mb-2">
          After launch, I hopped over to XY Planning Network where we built
          an archiving tool to help keep our members compliant. It's been a
          tool where I've learned a lot and wrote a lot of code. Most recently,
          I am pondering the best tooling to be effective and how shared internal
          libraries can make our work more robust.

          I had a fantasic time building rails applications for the Bethel
          family of companies. They are a scrappy group of people trying
          to do big things and taking lots of risks along the way. I had
          a fantastic team that helped to quickly grow my arhcitecural
          thinking as it relates to building scalable applications.

          managed our small team and created an
          environment without limits. This will always be a picture of
          what a small team can produce when the environment is right.

        <p class="text-gray-900 mb-2">
          NewBOS took a chance on me when I was fresh out of a Dev
          Bootcamp, and I was delighted to build actual tools for real
          people. This was a short-lived opportunity as I was the first
          primary web developer on the team and quickly saw my inadequacy
          and need for mentoring. I credit Jeff White for my spark in the
          industry, hiring me when I needed it, and I hope some value
          was created for the organization through my time there.

          Working with family is a wonderful and terrifying experience.
          I'm extremely grateful for this time as it had zero structure
          and forced me to think like an entreprenuer if I was going to
          provide any value to the business. My father taught me that no
          job is too small and lived out humility in the workplace. My
          sister taught me to stand tough and to do the right thing, even
          when the whole world seems against you.
